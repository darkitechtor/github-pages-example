# GitHub Pages example

The project consists of a [chart.py](chart.py) file for plotly chart generation and an html file [index.html](index.html) with plotly chart.

[Link to the page with the chart](https://darkitechtor.github.io/github-pages-example/).
## Some notes
It's better to name your html file "index.html" so it will be accessible as the main page.</br>
Othervise, you will have to specify the file name in the address, like:</br>
`https://darkitechtor.github.io/github-pages-example/non-standard_name.html`.</br>
Instead of:</br>
`https://darkitechtor.github.io/github-pages-example/`.
